Link to project frontend: https://master--superlative-stroopwafel-ed30f3.netlify.app/

I deployed the project online so there is no need to run it locally. I deployed the backend with Heroku (using JawsDB MySQL to connect to the database), and the frontend on Netlify. The front and the backend repositories are available on GitHub:

Backend repo: https://github.com/mariaclarabez/dndcharactermanager
Frontend repo: https://github.com/mariaclarabez/dndcharactermanager-frontend

If youâ€™d like to connect to the database that the deploy is using from MySQL Workbench, here are the credentials you should enter when you create a connection:
username: s5y9a3ujxzvy8oa7
password: u6tb3kmyk9um0wwl
url: bv2rebwf6zzsv341.cbetxkdyhwsb.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com port: 3306
database name: gi2bgc36753gjacn

The schema will already be there. Once you make the changes in the front-end, they will be reflected in the MySQL tables.
